              <strong> Pyrrhic is, Ole "HellBent" Madsen on bass, Øivind Vågane on drums, Sebastian Madsen and Roger
                Gregersen on Guitars and Emil Wynn as the vocalist.</strong>
              <br><br>
              A rocket launch into the metal scene of Agder is what we consider an apt, concise way to describe Pyrrhic.
              Of course the metal genre works a bit differently than the more mainstream genres, the way Pyrrhic went
              from nothing to hundres, then thousands and then ten thousands of listeners is impressive, and it makes
              sense. Take a listen.

            <h1>Pyrrhic</h1>
            <p class="hidden"> Pyrrhic is a band that knew what they wanted to do and trusted in their vision from early
              in their career. They immediately started decorating their instruments like
              guitars and drum fonts on their drums early into their public careers with logo design from an artist
              friend, Pale Fiend. This is what you can do when your band manages to garner fans with just an EP
              released. They were with only this EP set to perform at the Southern Discomfort Metal Festival. This
              allowed them to gain even more exposure and since some of the band
              members have played concerts before, this let them really show off what they could do even though
              technically their band has just recently become official.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr><br>
            <p class="hidden">
              Pyrrhic being an ambitious and enthusiastic band, did not let this go to waste. After their song, EP
              "Their dilapidated hands" and a festival performance, they followed up with their song " Deafening The
              Light"
              released on major platforms like spotify and apple music and a new ep. "Vile Slumber". Now this EP didn't
              technically release immediately, however some more interested fans in the industry were allowed an early
              listen and with that, Pyrrhic got
              their first official review. <a id="bandReview" target="_blank"
                href="https://occultblackmetalzine.blogspot.com/2020/08/pyrrhicvile-slumber2020-ep-review.html?m=1&fbclid=IwAR2mMU-hejRN-hmFLl8Vn5K0gXguv14x50lywvX1OPjI8URXYewCllheY-8">occultblackmetalzine</a>
              blessed
              Pyrrhic with an 8/10 rating on their second EP, even before release. Quite an achievement, hence why we
              thought it best to have that EP on the top of our page and of course, Pale Fiend came back to make the
              impressive artwork. Of course they came back to play at the Southern Discomfort Metal Festival, this time
              performing their EP Vile Slumber in it's entirety. Should not come as a surprise, such an impressive start
              and they're still going. Pyrrhic is a band to watch out for, truly.
